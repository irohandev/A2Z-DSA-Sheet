# Pattern Printing Guide

## Points to Remember for Pattern Printing

When writing code for pattern printing, keep the following points in mind:

1. **Outer Loops: Rows**  
   - The outer loop typically corresponds to the number of lines (or rows) in the pattern.  
   - Determine the total number of rows required based on the pattern's height.  

2. **Inner Loops: Columns**  
   - The inner loop handles the number of columns to print for each row.  
   - Establish a relationship between rows and columns to define the pattern (e.g., rows determine the number of columns or their positions).  

3. **Printing Characters**  
   - Inside the inner loop, use the `print` function to display the required characters (usually `"*"` for basic patterns).  

4. **Observe the Symmetry (Optional)**  
   - Analyze the pattern to identify any symmetry.  
   - Symmetry can help optimize the logic and simplify your approach.
